Welcome to the Word Changer Program

Here is how to play:
        For each round you will see two randomly selected words.
        You will have 1 minute to convert the first word to the second
        using only the following changes:
                Insert a character at position k (with k starting at 0)
                Delete a character at position k (with k starting at 0)
                Change a character at position k (with k starting at 0)
        For example, to change the word 'WEASEL' to 'SEASHELL' you could
        do the following:
                1) Change 'W' at position 0 to 'S': SEASEL
                2) Insert 'H' at position 4: SEASHEL
                3) Insert 'L' at position 7: SEASHELL
        Your goal is to make this conversion with the fewest changes.  Note
        that there may be more than one way to achieve this goal.
